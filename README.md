# Hey YOU!

Thanks for having a look at this thing.

## Disclaimer
- This is my very first project in Golang: please don't be offended by what you see here.
- I am getting inspired by a pretty extensive [tutorial found on the net](https://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/): interestingly enough I was looking on how to build ReST APIs in Golang, and Google presented me this page which happens to implement a To-do list... it is really true that Google knows what we need!
- My intention with the above tutorial is to first follow it, and then diverge to experiment with more stuff.
- Not being an API expert, I am also getting inspired by [this site](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html) about what the tutorial refers to as building a "responsible" ReST API.
